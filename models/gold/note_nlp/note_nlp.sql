-- This is quite messy, but there are multiple possible mappings from SNOMED CUIs to standard concepts.
-- This results in exploding rows (200m -> 650m) if we do a simple join.
-- To avoid this, we pre-select only one standard concept per SNOMED CUI based on the following criteria:
-- 1) Prefer mappings where the standard concept is in the same domain as the source concept
-- 2) Prefer mappings where the standard concept is in the same concept class as the source concept
-- 3) If multiple mappings still exist, choose the one with the lowest concept_id (for determinism)
-- This is arbitrary, but it means searching through these results can be done with this mapping.
